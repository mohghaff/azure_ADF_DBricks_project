Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the project that involves data processing and transformation using various Azure services and Databricks. The project consists of several key steps, including data ingestion, data transformation, and data storage, which are orchestrated using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics.

Project Workflow
The project workflow can be summarized into the following steps:

Step 1: Azure Data Factory Setup
Objective: Set up Azure Data Factory (ADF) to orchestrate data movement from an external source to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Details: In this step, an Azure Data Factory is created to manage data movement tasks. A pipeline is defined to copy raw data from a GitHub repository URL to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container.
Step 2: Data Movement to Azure Data Lake Gen2
Objective: Copy raw data from an external source (GitHub) to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Details: A pipeline in Azure Data Factory is executed to move data from a GitHub repository to the designated folder in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. This step ensures that raw data is available for further processing.
Step 3: Azure Databricks Setup
Objective: Create an Azure Databricks instance for data transformation and processing.
Details: In this step, an Azure Databricks workspace is set up, which provides a collaborative environment for data engineers and data scientists to work on data transformation tasks.
Step 4: Data Ingestion into Azure Databricks
Objective: Mount data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to Azure Databricks for data processing.
Details: An Azure Databricks cluster is created and configured. Application registration is used to securely mount the data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 into Azure Databricks, making the data accessible for analysis and transformation.
Step 5: Data Transformation in Azure Databricks
Objective: Transform the raw data using Azure Databricks notebooks.
Details: Data engineers and data scientists collaborate to read and transform the raw data using PySpark in Azure Databricks notebooks. Data types are adjusted, and any necessary transformations are applied to prepare the data for analysis.
Step 6: Data Loading into Azure Synapse Analytics
Objective: Load the transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for analytics and reporting.
Details: The transformed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly known as SQL Data Warehouse) to facilitate data analytics, reporting, and visualization.
Step 7: Data Storage and Organization
Objective: Organize and store the data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Details: The transformed data is organized into structured directories within Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for improved data management and accessibility.
Code Samples
Below are code samples that demonstrate key tasks within the project:

Mounting Data from Azure Data Lake to Azure Databricks
python
Copy code
# Configuration for mounting Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
configs = {
    "fs.azure.account.auth.type": "OAuth",
    "fs.azure.account.oauth2.provider.type": "org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.oauth2.ClientCredsTokenProvider",
    "fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint": "YOUR_AUTH_ENDPOINT"
}

# Check if the directory is already mounted
directory_to_check = "/mnt/olympics"
mounted_directories = [mount.mountPoint for mount in dbutils.fs.mounts()]

if directory_to_check in mounted_directories:
    print(f"The directory {directory_to_check} is already mounted.")
else:
    dbutils.fs.mount(
        source="abfss://olympics-data@olympicsadlg2.dfs.core.windows.net",
        mount_point="/mnt/olympics",
        extra_configs=configs
    )
Data Transformation Using PySpark
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType

# Example: Casting columns to IntegerType
entriesgender_df = entriesgender_df.select(
    col("Discipline"),
    col("Female").cast(IntegerType()).alias("Female"),
    col("Male").cast(IntegerType()).alias("Male"),
    col("Total").cast(IntegerType()).alias("Total")
)
Data Loading into Azure Synapse Analytics
python
Copy code
# Example: Writing data to Azure Synapse Analytics
athletes_df.repartition(1).write.mode("overwrite").option("header", 'true').csv("/mnt/olympics/transformed-data/athletes")
